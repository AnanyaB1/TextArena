# TextArena
A Collection of Competitive Text-Based Games for Language Model Evaluation and Reinforcement Learning




## General TODO
- there should be a dict of standardized game settings (setting i.e. max_turns, hardcore, etc. etc.)
- create an elo script
- update the required package list as necessary
- create minimal example training script
- create SFT dataset
- create loader (and agent wrapper for HuggingFace models)
