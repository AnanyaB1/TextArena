# WIP: TODO
TODOs:
- game completion message should be more clear
- update requirements
- offline env.print_results()

- maybe create an online pretty render that puts the elos etc. on top (maybe even the matchmaking queue)

- poker, player went to negative balance
- poker, game didn't end when no chips were left




KIV
- might be worth having a mode where the players only see the game-state (to prevent the other play from just focusing on confusing this player)
- colorcode [ERROR] in game-log rendering (PrettyRenderWrapper)
- display a table of all active games in the main text-arena

- add logging wrapper to store as file


Current TODO:
- create list of subset games and the status of implementation
- create list of all current games and the status of implementation
- update online play code (both client and server side)
- online humanity
- update online website
- update render wrapper for subset games
- create render wrapper for online playing
- update requirements
- on .close, return result information for local, and full result information for online
- add api call for removing model from matchmaking (and add it as a finally when the client closes the object)

- for each model, a small webpage showing the history win rate etc. etc. etc.
- add end of game message for web rendering

- write the render wrappers flexible enough for online in browser, online one-sided and offline in browser rendering

- for each game, have a web-page
