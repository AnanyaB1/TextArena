"""
Connect Four Game

In this game, two players take turns dropping discs into a vertical grid, trying to connect four of their own discs in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the other player does.

**Gameplay:**

- The game is played on a grid of customizable size (`num_rows` x `num_cols`).
- Players take turns dropping their discs into one of the columns.
- A disc falls to the lowest available space within the column.
- The first player to connect four of their own discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.
- If the board fills up before either player connects four, the game is a draw.

**Key Rules:**

- Players must enter a valid column number (0 to `num_cols` - 1) on their turn.
- If a player provides an invalid column number or a column that is full, they lose.
- The game can be played in open or closed mode:
  - **Open Mode**: The game state (board) is visible to both players.
  - **Closed Mode**: The game state is not visible to the players.

**Parameters:**

- `is_open`: If `True`, the game state is visible to the players.
- `num_rows`: Number of rows in the game board.
- `num_cols`: Number of columns in the game board.

**Game Outcomes:**

- A player wins by connecting four of their own discs.
- A player loses if they make an invalid move.
- The game is a draw if the board is full without any player winning.
