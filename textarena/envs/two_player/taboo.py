"""
Taboo Game

In this game, there are two players: the Clue Giver and the Guesser.

**Gameplay:**

- The Clue Giver is provided with a secret word (the word to guess) and a list of taboo words.
- The Clue Giver must provide clues to the Guesser without using the taboo words or the word to guess.
- The Guesser tries to guess the secret word based on the clues provided.
- If the Guesser correctly guesses the word, both players win.
- The game ends if the Clue Giver uses a taboo word or the word to guess, or if the turn limit is reached without a correct guess.

**Key Rules:**

- The Clue Giver must not use any of the taboo words or the word to guess in their clues.
- The Guesser can make guesses based on the clues provided.
- The game continues until the Guesser guesses correctly, the Clue Giver violates a rule, or the turn limit is reached.

**Parameters:**

- `max_turns`: The maximum number of turns before the game ends.

**Game Outcomes:**

- **Both players win**: If the Guesser correctly guesses the word.
- **Clue Giver loses**: If they use a taboo word or the word to guess in their clue.
- **Both players lose**: If the turn limit is reached without a correct guess.
