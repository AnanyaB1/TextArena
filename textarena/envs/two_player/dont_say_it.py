Don't Say It Game

Each player is given a secret word that they must try to get the other player to say during the course of the game. 
Players take turns speaking to each other, attempting to subtly guide the conversation towards the other's secret word. 
If a player successfully gets the other player to say their secret word, they win the game. 
If a player accidentally says the other player's secret word, they lose the game. 
The game ends either when one player says the other player's word or when the maximum number of turns is reached. 
If the turn limit is reached without either player saying the other's word, the game ends in a draw.

Key Rules:
1. Each player has a secret word that they must protect while trying to make the other player say their word.
2. Players can converse freely but should be subtle to avoid giving away their secret word.
3. The game ends if either player says the other's secret word or when the maximum number of turns is reached.

Parameters:
- `max_turns`: The maximum number of turns allowed before the game ends in a draw.
- `render`: If set to True, the game state and actions are printed for debugging purposes.
- `data_path`: The path to the JSON file containing the list of possible secret words.

Game Outcomes:
- A player wins if they successfully make the other player say their secret word.
- A player loses if they accidentally say the other player's secret word.
- The game is a draw if the turn limit is reached without either player saying the other's word.
