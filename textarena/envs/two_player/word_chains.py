Word Chains Game

In this game, two players take turns to say words that start with the last letter of the previous word.

**Gameplay:**

- The game starts with a random English word.
- Players take turns to provide a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word.
- Words cannot be repeated.
- If a player provides an invalid word, repeats a word, or fails to follow the sequence, they lose.
- The game ends when a player loses or the maximum number of turns is reached.

**Key Rules:**

- The word must start with the last letter of the previous word.
- The word must be a valid English word.
- Words cannot be repeated.
- Players must provide their word enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `[apple]`.

**Parameters:**

- `max_turns`: The maximum number of turns before the game ends in a draw.

**Game Outcomes:**

- A player loses if they provide an invalid word, repeat a word, or fail to follow the sequence.
- The game is a draw if the maximum number of turns is reached without any player losing.
