Debate Game

In this game, two players engage in a debate on a given topic. Each player is assigned a sideâ€”Affirmative or Negative.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Topic Selection**: A random debate topic is chosen.
2. **Role Assignment**: Players are randomly assigned to the Affirmative or Negative side.
3. **Pre-Debate Voting**: Simulated judges cast their initial votes based solely on the topic.
4. **Debate Turns**: Players take turns presenting their arguments over a fixed number of turns.
5. **Post-Debate Voting**: Judges cast their votes again after the debate.
6. **Winner Determination**: The player whose side gains the most votes compared to the pre-debate votes wins.

**Key Rules:**

- Players must argue for their assigned side.
- The debate lasts for a predetermined number of turns.
- The winner is determined based on the change in votes from pre-debate to post-debate.

**Parameters:**

- `max_turns`: Number of turns each player has to present their arguments.
- `num_judges`: Number of simulated judges evaluating the debate.
- `topics_path`: Path to the JSON file containing debate topics.

**Game Outcomes:**

- **Win**: The player whose side gains more votes after the debate wins.
- **Tie**: If both sides gain an equal number of votes, the game is a tie.
