Spelling Bee Game

In this game, each player tries to create the longest possible English word using a given set of allowed letters.

**Gameplay:**

- A set of six unique lowercase letters is randomly generated and provided to both players.
- Players must create the longest valid English word using only the allowed letters.
- Each letter can be used multiple times in a word.
- Players submit their words simultaneously.
- The player with the longer valid word wins.
- If both words are of equal length, the game is a draw.
- If a player submits an invalid word, they lose.

**Key Rules:**

- Words must be composed only of the allowed letters.
- Each letter can be used multiple times.
- Words must be valid English words.
- Players must wrap their word in square brackets, e.g., `[example]`.

**Parameters:**

- No additional parameters are required for this game.

**Game Outcomes:**

- A player wins by submitting a longer valid word than the opponent.
- A player loses if they submit an invalid word.
- The game is a draw if both players submit words of equal length.
