"""
Truth and Deception Game

In this game, there are two players: the Deceiver and the Guesser.

- **Deceiver**: Knows which of two presented facts is correct and tries to convince the Guesser to pick the incorrect one.
- **Guesser**: Must determine which of the two facts is correct based on the conversation.

**Gameplay:**

1. Both players are presented with two facts. The Deceiver knows which one is correct.
2. Players engage in a conversation for a fixed number of turns.
3. After the conversation, the Guesser makes a guess.
4. The game ends, and rewards are assigned based on the Guesser's choice.

**Key Rules:**

- The Deceiver aims to mislead the Guesser into choosing the wrong fact.
- The Guesser aims to correctly identify the true fact.
- The conversation lasts for a predetermined number of turns.
- The Guesser must choose "Fact 1" or "Fact 2" after the conversation ends.

**Parameters:**

- `max_turns`: Maximum number of conversation turns before the Guesser must make a guess.
- `data_path`: Path to the JSON file containing the facts data.

**Game Outcomes:**

- **Guesser wins**: If they correctly identify the true fact.
- **Deceiver wins**: If the Guesser chooses the incorrect fact.
- **Game ends**: After the Guesser makes a guess.
